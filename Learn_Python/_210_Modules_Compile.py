The module compileall can create .pyc files (or .pyo files when -O is used) for all modules in a directory.

A program doesn’t run any faster when it is read from a .pyc or .pyo file than when it is read from a .py file; 
the only thing that’s faster about .pyc or .pyo files is the speed with which they are loaded.
